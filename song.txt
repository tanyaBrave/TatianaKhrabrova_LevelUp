Ashley Barrett Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)

I dig my hole, you build a wall
I dig my hole, you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall

Gonna build that city on a hill
Gonna build that city on a hill
Someday those tears are gonna spill

So build that wall and build it strong
'Cause we'll be there before too long
