Ashley Barrett Build That Wall (Zia's Theme)

I dig my hole, you build a wall
I dig my hole, you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall

Gonna build that city on a hill
Gonna build that city on a hill
Someday those tears are gonna spill

So build that wall and build it strong
'Cause we'll be there before too long

Gonna build that wall up to the sky
Gonna build that wall up to the sky
Someday your bird is gonna fly

Gonna build that wall until it's done
Gonna build that wall until it's done
But now you've got nowhere to run

So build that wall and build it strong
'Cause we'll be there before too long
